# Advent of Code 2021!

The excercises from the annual AoC event found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021). Each day as well as each part is seperated into their own projects, I wanted to do this so if part 2 required a whole refactor to the initial code, I can look back and see what I could've done initially to help future me out.
